# Introduction

This project demonstrates a unique approach to the understanding and identification of stress levels experienced by the general population. Excessive stress has been linked to negative impacts on both physical and mental well-being, including an increased risk of heart disease, sleep disorders, digestive issues, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of community stress levels is not only relevant for individual health but also for the overall well-being of society.
